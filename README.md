### Opinion
<p>
    I know, I know, what the hell is an opinion section doing in an open source project?
    I grew into this career field at the time Microsoft started to grow into the mega-corporation it is.
    I remember when the browser wars happened and how Microsoft used its control of the OS platform to squash Netscape in
    a sometimes an illegal fashion and most of the time, immorally. I remember when Sun Microsystems introduced
    Java and Microsoft tried to break it by corrupting the standard with their own extensions, therefore
    creating applications that were not compatible across JVM's and operating systems.
